read ish8.tar2 for Ishtar/ishtaru
(I need to level this out throughout the atf. sometimes I have used IŠ₈.DAR and sometimes IŠ₈.TAR₂ and sometimes iš₈-tar₂)

use %s to switch rubrics to Sumerian
use %sb at the start of the next line to switch back

use {m} and {f} instead of {I} with PN

USE:
GEŠTU-2(diš){+a-a} etc. for MIN sign used with a noun.

Fix rubrics so that Sumerian is in upper case letters
